You’ll also learn some advanced language features that recently have become more common in Python code. Explore Python’s major built-in object types such as numbers, lists, and dictionaries Create and process objects with Python statements, and learn Python’s general syntax model Use functions to avoid code redundancy and package code for reuse Organize statements, functions, and other tools into larger components with modules Dive into classes: Python’s object-oriented programming tool for structuring code Write large programs with Python’s exception-handling model and development tools Learn advanced Python tools, including decorators, descriptors, metaclasses, and Unicode processing","{""amount"":47.99,""currencyCode"":""USD""}",3.5,11,2013-06-12,1600
Python for Kids,A Playful Introduction to Programming,"[""Jason R. Briggs""]","Introduces the basics of the Python programming language, covering how to use data structures, organize and reuse code, draw shapes and patterns with turtle, and create games and animations with tkinter.",,5,1,2013,344
Python,,"[""Chris Fehily""]","Named after the Monty Python comedy troupe, Python is an interpreted, open-source, object-oriented programming language. It's also free and runs portably on Windows, Mac OS, Unix, and other operating systems. Python can be used for all manner of programming tasks, from CGI scripts to full-fledged applications. It is gaining popularity among programmers in part because it is easier to read (and hence, debug) than most other programming languages, and it's generally simpler to install, learn, and use. Its line structure forces consistent indentation. Its syntax and semantics make it suitable for simple scripts and large programs. Its flexible data structures and dynamic typing allow you to get a lot done in a few lines. To learn it, you'll need is some basic programming experience and a copy of Python: Visual QuickStart Guide. In patented Visual QuickStart Guide fashion, the book doesn't just tell you how to use Python to develop applications, it shows you, breaking Python into easy-to-digest, step-by-step tasks and providing example code. Python: Visual QuickStart Guide emphasizes the core language and libraries, which are the building blocks for programs. Author Chris Fehily starts with the basics - expressions, statements, numbers, strings - then moves on to lists, dictionaries, functions, and modules before wrapping things up with straightforward discussions of exceptions and classes. Some additional topics covered include:- Object-oriented programming- Working in multiple operating systems- Structuring large programs- Comparing Python to C, Perl, and Java- Handling errors gracefully.",,3,2,2002,410
Next-Generation Web Frameworks in Python,,"[""Liza Daly""]","With its flexibility, readability, and maturecode libraries, Python is a naturalchoice for developing agile and maintainableweb applications. Severalframeworks have emerged in the last fewyears that share ideas with Ruby on Railsand leverage the expressive nature of Python.This Short Cut will tell you whatyou need to know about the hottest fullstackframeworks: Django, Pylons, andTurboGears. Their philosophies, relativestrengths, and development status aredescribed in detail. What you won't find out is, ""Which oneshould I use?"" The short answer is thatall of them can be used to build web applications-the challenge for the readeris to find the one that fits his or herproject or coding style best.",,5,1,2007-04-18,43
Python Programming,An Introduction to Computer Science,"[""John M. Zelle""]","This book is suitable for use in a university-level first course in computing (CS1), as well as the increasingly popular course known as CS0. It is difficult for many students to master basic concepts in computer science and programming. A large portion of the confusion can be blamed on the complexity of the tools and materials that are traditionally used to teach CS1 and CS2. This textbook was written with a single overarching goal: to present the core concepts of computer science as simply as possible without being simplistic.",,4,17,2004,517
Effective Python,59 Specific Ways to Write Better Python,"[""Brett Slatkin""]","It's easy to start writing code with Python: that's why the language is so immensely popular. However, Python has unique strengths, charms, and expressivity that can be hard to grasp at first -- as well as hidden pitfalls that can easily trip you up if you aren't aware of them. Effective Python will help you harness the full power of Python to write exceptionally robust, efficient, maintainable, and well-performing code. Utilizing the concise, scenario-driven style pioneered in Scott Meyers's best-selling Effective C++, Brett Slatkin brings together 53 Python best practices, tips, shortcuts, and realistic code examples from expert programmers. Through realistic examples, Slatkin uncovers little-known Python quirks, intricacies, and idioms that powerfully impact code behavior and performance. You'll learn how to choose the most efficient and effective way to accomplish key tasks when multiple options exist, and how to write code that's easier to understand, maintain, and improve. Drawing on his deep understanding of Python's capabilities, Slatkin offers practical advice for each major area of development with both Python 3.x and Python 2.x. Coverage includes: * Algorithms * Objects * Concurrency * Collaboration * Built-in modules * Production techniques * And more Each section contains specific, actionable guidelines organized into items, each with carefully worded advice supported by detailed technical arguments and illuminating examples. Using Effective Python, you can systematically improve all the Python code you write: not by blindly following rules or mimicking incomprehensible idioms, but by gaining a deep understanding of the technical reasons why they make sense.",,,,2015-02-01,256
Python for Bioinformatics,,"[""Jason Kinser""]","Bioinformatics is a growing field that attracts researchers from many different backgrounds who are unfamiliar with the algorithms commonly used in the field. Python for Bioinformatics provides a clear introduction to the Python programming language and instructs beginners on the development of simple programming exercises . Ideal for those with some knowledge of computer programming languages, this book emphasizes Python syntax and methodologies. The text is divided into three complete sections; the first provides an explanation of general Python programming, the second includes a detailed discussion of the Python tools typically used in bioinformatics including clustering, associative memories, and mathematical analysis techniques, and the third section demonstrates how these tools are implemented through numerous applications.",,,,2010-10-25,417
